By AndrewRigg and Golpette.

It's puzzle game adventure fun time madness. No longer restricted to crosswords, this program also generates wordsearches and
(soon) sudokus too
   
     
     

Program written in Java. Using the program in its current form:

Choose your puzzle, size and difficulty from the initial screen. 
(Languages are currently obsolete, as is sudoku and the crossword difficulty).

Crosswords: generated randomly using an English word list of ~17,000 words with clues corresponding to dictionary definitions. 
Scroll through the puzzle with arrow keys or mouse and enter solution using keyboard. Check your solution with the 
"Show solution" button, or get hints by hovering over the space below the clues and clicking "Hint".

Wordsearch: to highlight word, click on the initial letter, followed by the final letter of the word. You can cheat using 
the "Show solution" button Difficulty levels restrict word directionality (only vertical and horizontal for easy to
the inclusiong of "word snakes" for expert - though you can't actually highlight these yet). Hover over the word list
to re-order them as you like.

Sudoku: to do.
